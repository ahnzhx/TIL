the allocation of requested block X is actually a two-step process.
the two steps must be performed in the following order

1. make space for the requested block x. if all blocks in the set are valid, then a victim block V must be singled out
for eviction, according to the replacement policy. 
if this victim block V is dirty, then a write of the victim block V must be issued to the next level of the memory hierarchy.

2. bring in the requested block X. Issue a read of the requested block x to the next level of the memory hierarchy
and put the requested block X in the appropriate place in the set (as per step 1).
